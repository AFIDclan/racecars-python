To write your own player for the Python Racing League, you'll need the following information about the environment, available tools, and necessary components:

## **Player Class**
You need to inherit from the Player base class provided by the racing library.

```python
from lib.Player import Player
```
The constructor of your player class must accept two arguments:

1) **map**: A reference to the current map object (used for casting rays).
2) **color**: A tuple representing the RGB color of your player.

## **Car Object**
Your player interacts with the car it controls through the self.car attribute. The car provides the following properties and methods:

**Car Attributes**
* **throttle**: A float value between -1.0 and 1.0 controlling the car's acceleration.
    * 1.0 = full throttle forward.
    * -1.0 = full brake or reverse.
* **steer**: A float value between -1.0 and 1.0 controlling the steering angle.
    * 1.0 = full turn to the right.
    * -1.0 = full turn to the left.
    * 0.0 = straight.
* **drifting**: A boolean flag indicating whether the car is sliding.
* **forward_velocity**: A float value representing the car's forward velocity (positive when moving forward, negative when reversing).

**Car Methods**
* `cast_ray(angle, step=4, max_distance=300)`: Casts a ray from the car at a specified angle (in radians) and returns a Ray object. The ray will step by `step` until it hits a max range of max_distance.

## **Ray Object**
The Ray object represents the result of a raycast and provides the following attributes:

* **angle**: The angle (in radians) at which the ray was cast.
* **did_hit**: A boolean indicating whether the ray hit an obstacle.
* **distance**: A float representing the distance to the hit point, or the maximum range of the ray if nothing was hit.
* **hit_point**: A tuple (x, y) of the world coordinates where the ray hit an obstacle (if did_hit is True).

## **Required Methods**
Your player class must implement the following two methods:

`cast_rays(self)`
This method defines the set of rays your car will use for sensing the environment. It should return a list of Ray objects created by calling self.car.cast_ray.

`control(self, rays)`
This method defines how your car will respond to the environment. It receives the list of Ray objects generated by cast_rays and should update the car's throttle and steer attributes.

## **Game Loop**
During each game update, your player's cast_rays method is called to gather environmental data, followed by the control method to decide the car's actions based on the sensed data. The game handles physics and updates the car's state accordingly.

## **Map Object**
The map object passed to your player provides details about the race track and is used for raycasting. Its specific attributes or methods, if any, depend on the implementation of the racing library.

## **Environment**
The race track consists of walls and other obstacles that rays can detect. The goal is to navigate the track as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions and managing turns effectively.
